pyChroma is based on mattt's chroma-hash experiment. 
It got me to think - what if we could use this as a re-authentication technique instead of the default?
Well the end product is pyChroma, which currently supports SHA1 and MD5 algorithms and can be integrated with vBulletin
and Django backends (the authentication platform).

Basic Usage:

	
	from Chroma import chroma
	
	obj = chroma("sha1$a1976$a36cc8cbf81742a8fb52e221aaeab48ed7f58ab4", 
		alg = "SHA", 
		backend = "django") # A django-authentication styled backend via SHA1 digest
	
	str(obj) # The hashed colors
	obj.javascript # Complete frontend javascript for Chroma-Hash including the algorithm
	
	obj.md5_js # the hex_md5 javascript function
	obj.sha_js # the hex_sha1 javascript function
	obj.engine # the digest engine
	obj.jsengine # the javascript digest engine
	obj.frontend # the method for returning the hash
	obj.salt # the extracted salt for the digest algorithm

v2 - Automates the generation of the javascript + Added support for Django and vBulletin backends and all of the js dependencies (cept for jquery)
v1 - Enables basic hashing
