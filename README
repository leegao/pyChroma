@note:
    This is a re-implementation of mattt*'s Chroma-Hash calculator.
    http://mattt.me/2009/07/chroma-hash-a-belated-introduction/
@param param: 
    password: The password to chroma-hash
    default: The number of colors to return
    _hash: If the password is already hashed by another algorithm or is
           already a MD5 hash, then the _hash function (which takes only one parameter)
           will return a MD5 compatible hash
           SHA1 will be implemented when mattt decides to update his Chroma-Hash specs
@return: 
    chroma object with 1-4 HTML color items.
@ivar ivar:
    chroma.colors - array of the chroma-hashed colors
Example:    
    from Chroma import chroma
    myColors = chroma("password")
